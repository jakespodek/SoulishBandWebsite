                <p>Soulish is a 6-piece Indie Rock/Hip-Hop
                band hailing from Toronto. Soulish blends
                the rhythmic and storytelling aspects of
                Hip-Hop with the raw energy and experi-
                mental edge of Indie Rock. With a diverse
                cast of members, an eclectic and wide
                range of influences permeate our collective
                sound, resulting in music that sounds both
                organic and sample-based at the same
                time. The variety of genres and sounds
                we incorporate is representative of the
                cumulative experiences of all the mem-
                bers of the band, and of the cultural melt-
                ing pot that is the City of Toronto.</p>

                <p>Lead by <span>Cole Solish</span> as the Rhythm Guitar-
                ist and primary lyricist, Soulish continues to
                explore genre-bending sound. Lead Vocal-
                ist <span>Chris Hylton</span> brings his classical vocal
                training to provide a lens into the stories of
                a band growing both as people and profes-
                sional musicians in Toronto. The Rhythm
                section is comprised of brothers <span>Hector
                and Ernesto Alonso</span> on Drums and Bass
                respectively. Their musical connection is
                unmatched and creates the backbone of our
                sonic chemistry. The band is rounded out
                by life-long friends <span>Jakob Goldstein</span> and
                <span>Joshua Napal</span> carrying the Lead Guitar and
                Synthesizer responsibilities. Their unique
                approach to song craft and tone-building are
                key in establishing our musical presence.</p>
            
                <p>Soulish is currently working with
                Toronto based musician, professor
                (York University), and producer,
                Robb Cappelletto, on a series of new
                songs to be released at the end of
                2022 and into early 2023.</p>
