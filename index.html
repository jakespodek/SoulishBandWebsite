                    Formed in 2020, Soulish is a 6-piece Indie-Soul band from Toronto. Made up of a diverse group of members united by a love of music, storytelling, and a drive to perform while leaning into their unique backgrounds to create a musical experience like no other. Their distinctive sound blends the rhythmic and storytelling aspects of Hip-Hop/RnB with the raw energy and experimental edge of Indie Rock and Alternative music. An eclectic range of influences leads to a vibe that sounds both spontaneous and sample-based, almost like The Weeknd and Arctic Monkeys morphed into one group. The variety of genres and life experiences they weave together is representative of their cumulative experiences growing up in the cultural melting pot that is Toronto. Sharing stories of struggle, ambition, love, and relationships with a sense of humor that keeps the vibe fun and lively.

                    Soulish has been tearing their way through the Toronto music scene playing with a variety of bands, and promoters in venues across the GTA, including Sneaky Dee's, The Rivoli, and Lee's Palace. With a growing fanbase, they have been provided opportunities to play larger events such as headlining for Toronto based promotion company A-Minor's 7-year anniversary show.

                    Lead by <span>Cole Solish</span> as the Rhythm Guitarist, Soulish is dedicated to exploring genre-bending techniques to craft a unique sonic signature. Lead Vocalist <span>Chris Hylton</span> asserts his classical vocal training to provide a lens into the lives and stories of a band through his immense talent and raw emotional feel. The Rhythm section is comprised of brothers <span>Hector and Ernesto Alonso</span> on Drums and Bass respectively. Their musical connection is unmatched and creates the backbone of the band's musical chemistry. The band is rounded out by life-long friends <span>Jakob Goldstein</span> and <span>Joshua Napal</span> carrying the Lead Guitar and Synthesizer responsibilities. Their unique approach to song craft and improvisation are key to creating a unique experience night in and night out.

                <p>
                    Soulish is currently working with Toronto based musician Robb Cappelletto on two upcoming EP's, 'Living History' (March 17, 2023) and 'BGR' (May 2023). In anticipation of the release of 'Living History', Soulish has released their debut single, 'Symbiotic'. This song is about confronting a toxic relationship and reflecting on the damages left in the aftermath. It's that overwhelming feeling of being so trapped in your own feelings towards a lover, friend, or family member and not being able to see beyond that layer of frustration and betrayal. But in the end, we all know it takes 2 to tango and any toxic relationship goes both ways. We all wish it could just be erased and start over when things were good, but once the damage is done it's too far gone and that trust is just never gonna return.
