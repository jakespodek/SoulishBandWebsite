                    Formed in 2020, Soulish is a 6-piece Indie-Soul band from Toronto. We are a diverse group of members united by a love of music, storytelling, and a drive to perform while leaning into our unique backgrounds to create a musical experience like no other. Our distinctive sound blends the rhythmic and storytelling aspects of Hip-Hop/RnB with the raw energy and experimental edge of Indie, Rock and Alternative music. Our eclectic range of influences lead to a vibe that sounds both spontaneous and sample-based, taking inspiration from artists such as The Grateful Dead, The Weeknd, and Arctic Monkeys. The variety of genres and life experiences we weave together is representative of our cumulative experiences growing up in the cultural melting pot that is Toronto. Sharing our stories of struggle, ambition, love, and relationships with a sense of humor that keeps the vibe fun and lively.
                </p>
