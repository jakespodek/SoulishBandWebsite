        <p>Soulish is a 6-piece Indie Rock/Hip-Hop
        band hailing from Toronto. Soulish blends
        the rhythmic and storytelling aspects of
        Hip-Hop with the raw energy and experi-
        mental edge of Indie Rock. With a diverse
        cast of members, an eclectic and wide
        range of influences permeate our collective
        sound, resulting in music that sounds both
        organic and sample-based at the same
        time. The variety of genres and sounds
        we incorporate is representative of the
        cumulative experiences of all the mem-
        bers of the band, and of the cultural melt-
        ing pot that is the City of Toronto.</p>
    
        <p>Lead by Cole Solish as the Rhythm Guitar-
        ist and primary lyricist, Soulish continues to
        explore genre-bending sound. Lead Vocal-
        ist Chris Hylton brings his classical vocal
        training to provide a lens into the stories of
        a band growing both as people and profes-
        sional musicians in Toronto. The Rhythm
        section is comprised of brothers Hector
        and Ernesto Alonso on Drums and Bass
        respectively. Their musical connection is
        unmatched and creates the backbone of our
        sonic chemistry. The band is rounded out
        by life-long friends Jakob Goldstein and
        Joshua Napal carrying the Lead Guitar and
        Synthesizer responsibilities. Their unique
        approach to song craft and tone-building are
        key in establishing our musical presence.</p>
    
        <p>Soulish is currently working with
        Toronto based musician, professor
        (York University), and producer,
        Robb Cappelletto, on a series of new
        songs to be released at the end of
        2022 and into early 2023.</p>
